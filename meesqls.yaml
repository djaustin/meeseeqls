# Meesqls works on the basis of connectors which represent target databases, the queries 
# being run against them, and additional information like the polling interval and metadata
connectors:
  # Connector definition 
  - name: new york # A label used to identify this connector. Logs will be tagged with this name
    query: select sysdate from dual # The query to be run against the database
    database:
      username: user # The username that will be used to connect to the database
      password: pass # The password of the user used to connect to the database
      connectionString: 192.168.1.3/NY # The Oracle connection string containing the host and SID to connect to
    sourceName: bristol # The name of the location Meesqls is being run from
    destinationName: new york # The name of the location of the target database
    pollingInterval: 1 # The number of SECONDS between query executions 
    
  # Example second connector, an arbitrary number can be provided
  # - name: rotterdam
  #   query: select count(*) from event
  #   database:
  #     username: user 
  #     password: pass
  #     connectionString: 192.168.1.4/RT
  #   sourceName: bristol
  #   destinationName: rotterdam
  #   pollingInterval: 2

# Meesqls will output a new-line separated list of JSON objects for ingest into a document store like Elasticsearch
output: 
  path: ./meesqls.json # The relative or absolute path of the output file
